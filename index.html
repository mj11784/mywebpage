 <h5>  how chelsea fc got there badge design!
     
     
 <h5>  Chelsea’s crest has had a total of five major redesigns in its history. The original lion appeared in the club crest in 1953. It was based on the civic coat of arms for what was the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea in London. It also included elements inspired by the arms of Earl Cadogan, who was club president at the time, as well as the Abbots of Westminster, former Lords of the Manor of Chelsea.

   <h5>The Blues first wore shirts with numbers during our match against Swansea City in August 1928. At the time, it was a news-worthy innovation for the game. It allowed spectators to give credit to individual players’ performances more easily, especially the young and relatively unknown players on the squad. However, kits with numbers didn’t become a standard in England until almost a decade later in 1939

 <h5>     The freehold of the ground and the naming rights of Stamford Bridge stadium are owned by Chelsea Pitch Owners PLC (CPO), a unique organization with more than 21,000 shares owned by the fans. Established in 1992 by then club chairman Ken Bates, its primary mission is to ensure that Chelsea supporters can continue to watch football at Stamford Bridge. CPO leases the stadium to us, and the club runs the stadium and everything to do with it.
